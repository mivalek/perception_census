  // Task description

  // NOTE: 28 Feb - forget about n of trials between asking a subjective report; 
  // There will likely be 4 different subjective questions, we want to ask each question twice. 
  // I have done this in the pitch discrimination task but it is not very efficient or pretty. 

  /* The Tonality Alignment Test assesses participants' ability to determine whether a stream of sung pitches was aligned
    with a tonal template. Participants are told they will hear 22 melodies, some of which would be in tune, and
    some of which would not be in tune. See Tierney et al. (2021) for more details on how the stimuli were created

    After each stimulus participants are asked to indicate whether the melody they heard
    was in tune (by pressing a button marked “in tune”) or out of tune (by pressing a button marked
    “out of tune”). To start with, let's set the time limit on this question to 5s.

    Then on a number of trials, participants are asked to report how confident they were their response was correct on
    a scale from 50 (random guess) to 100 (complete confidence). To start with, let's set the time limit on this question to 5s.
    The next trial should start after some reasonable ISI, e.g. 0.5s.

    The stimuli are located in Stimuli/TonalityAlignmentStimuli.

    !!NOTE: we want this task to be accessible to people with vision deficiencies meaning all written/visual  elements should be compatible with screen readers.
